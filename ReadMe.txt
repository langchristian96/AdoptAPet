 - KEEP CALM AND ADOPT A PET -
The “Keep calm and adopt a pet” shelter needs a software application to help them find adoptive
parents for the dogs they are taking care of. The application can be used in two modes: administrator
and user. When the application is started, it will offer the option to choose the mode.
Administrator mode: The application will have a database, which holds all the dogs in the shelter at a
given moment. The shelter employees must be able to update the database, meaning: add a new dog,
delete a dog (when the dog is adopted) and update the information of a dog. Each Dog has a breed, a
name, an age and a photograph. The photograph is memorised as a link towards an online resource (the
photograph on the presentation site of the centre). The administrators will also have the option to see
all the dogs in the shelter.
User mode: A user can access the application and choose one or more dogs to adopt. The application
will allow the user to:
a. See the dogs in the database, one by one. When the user chooses this option, the data of the
first dog (breed, name, age) is displayed, along with its photograph.
b. Choose to adopt the dog, in which case the dog is added to the user’s adoption list.
c. Choose not to adopt the dog and to continue to the next. In this case, the information
corresponding to the next dog is shown and the user is again offered the possibility to adopt it.
This can continue as long as the user wants, as when arriving to the end of the list, if the user
chooses next, the application will again show the first dog.
d. See all the dogs of a given breed, having an age less than a given number. If the breed is empty,
then all the dogs will be considered. The same options (a, b and c) apply in this case.
e. See the adoption list.
